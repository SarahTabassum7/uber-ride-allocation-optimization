# Uber Ride Allocation Optimization

## Overview
Analytics and modeling to reduce ride assignment lag by forecasting demand and improving driver allocation. The project combines data profiling, regression modeling, and decision dashboards.

## Business Problem
Uneven driver distribution and unpredictable demand spikes cause assignment delays and lower fulfillment efficiency.

## Responsibilities
- Collected and profiled historical ride/driver datasets; addressed anomalies and data gaps.
- Built regression models in Python to forecast demand across regions/time windows.
- Designed Power BI dashboards visualizing allocation delays, driver utilization, and demand trends.
- Ran what-if scenarios to evaluate dispatch strategies and quantify expected improvements.

## Results & Impact
- Reduced assignment lag through more accurate demand forecasting and allocation rules.
- Provided a repeatable approach for regional tuning and operational decision-making.

## Analysis Approach
- Data profiling: missing values, outliers, temporal alignment.
- Feature engineering: time-of-day, weekday/weekend, region, historical moving averages.
- Modeling: regression baseline; compare MAE/RMSE across feature sets.
- Scenario testing: simulate driver repositioning and threshold rules.

## Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Power BI, Excel
